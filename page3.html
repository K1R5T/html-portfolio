            The above image is a link to my GitHub, on there at the moment I have a couple of repositories, one which is
            a website I created when I did the 3 week Develop Coding course with CodeNation.

        <p>
            I have attched the website for CodeNation so that you can see who they are and what they have to offer,
            because without these guys I would not be where I am today.
