        <p class="code">
            I joined CodeNation to gain the skills I need to become a Software Developer, but that is not the only
            reason. I have wanted to work with technology since I was young and CodeNation was recommended by my brother
            who knew they would look after me and help me fulfill my dreams of working with technology.

        <p class="week">
            In week one I hope to learn the basics of Javascript, and have a basic understanding of how functions work,
            the correct syntax to use and how it all fits together.

    <div>
        <p class="one">
            I have completed week one of the Master Coding Course and now understand the basics of Javascript, I have
            learnt many different things including functions, loops and if else, I have learnt a lot more than this but
            these are the few that I spent the most time on in week one to help me get a better understanding of what
            they are, what they do and how they work.
