            <p>
                I joined CodeNation to gain the skills I need to become a Software Developer, but that is not the only
                reason. I have wanted to work with technology since I was young and CodeNation was recommended by my brother
                who knew they would look after me and help me fulfill my dreams of working with technology.

            <p>
                In week one I hope to learn the basics of Javascript, and have a basic understanding of how functions work,
                the correct syntax to use and how it all fits together.

                I have completed week one of the Master Coding Course and now understand the basics of Javascript, I have
                learnt many different things including functions, loops and if else, I have learnt a lot more than this but
                these are the few that I spent the most time on in week one to help me get a better understanding of what
                they are, what they do and how they work.
